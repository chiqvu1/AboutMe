        Hi, my name is Chi.
        \n\nI am currently a student at College of Southern Nevada.
        \n\nI am an avid traveler, yoga enthusiastic, and aspiring programming wizard.
        \n\nHere\'s a little bit more about me in the words of the amazing Janelle Monae:
        \n\n\"Sometimes a mystery, sometimes I\'m free
        \n\nDepending on my mood or my attitude
        \n\nSometimes I wanna roll or stay at home
        \n\nWalking contradiction, guess I\'m factual and fiction..."
        \n\nAnd here\'s my life mantra by the three beautiful women of Destiny\'s Child:
        \n\n\"I\'m a survivor, I\'m not gonna give up
        \n\nI\'m not gonna stop, I\'m gonna work harder
        \n\nI\'m a survivor, I\'m gonna make it
        \n\nI will survive, keep on surviving...\"
